# SVF-PropDbReader

## Overview

**SVF-PropDbReader** is a .NET library for reading and extracting property database (PropDb) information from SVF (Simple Vector Format) files. SVF is the proprietary 3D model format used by Autodesk in the Autodesk Platform Services (APS) Viewer (formerly Forge Viewer). This library enables developers to programmatically access and analyze property data embedded in SVF models, which is essential for BIM, CAD, and digital twin applications.

SVF files are typically generated by Autodesk tools and are used to stream 3D models efficiently in web applications. The PropDb is a key component of SVF, storing metadata and properties for all model elements.

## Features

- Read and parse PropDb from SVF packages
- Extract properties for model elements (e.g., name, category, custom attributes)
- Support for manifest and property database structure
- Download and manage SVF/PropDb resources
- Designed for integration with APS/Forge workflows

## Installation

Add the NuGet package to your project:

```shell
# Using .NET CLI
 dotnet add package SVF.PropDbReader

# Or using Package Manager
 Install-Package SVF.PropDbReader
```

## Usage

### 1. Reading Properties from a Local Property Database (.sdb)

```csharp
using SVF.PropDbReader;

string dbPath = @"C:\path\to\your\properties.sdb";

using var reader = new PropDbReader(dbPath);

// Get properties for a specific dbId (e.g., 1)
var props = await reader.GetPropertiesForDbIdAsync(1);

foreach (var prop in props)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"{prop.Key}: {prop.Value}");
}
```

### 2. Downloading and Reading Properties from Autodesk APS (by URN)

```csharp
using SVF.PropDbReader;

string accessToken = "<YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>";
string urn = "<YOUR_MODEL_URN>";

using var reader = new PropDbReader(accessToken, urn);

// Get properties for a specific dbId (e.g., 1)
var props = await reader.GetPropertiesForDbIdAsync(1);

foreach (var prop in props)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"{prop.Key}: {prop.Value}");
}
```

## API Reference

### `PropDbReader`

#### Constructors

- `PropDbReader(string dbPath)`

  - **Description:** Initializes a new instance of `PropDbReader` for reading properties from a local SVF property database file (`.sdb`).
  - **Parameters:**
    - `dbPath` (`string`): The full path to the local SVF property database file.
  - **Usage:** Use this constructor when you have already downloaded the SVF `.sdb` property database file to your local machine.

- `PropDbReader(string accessToken, string urn)`
  - **Description:** Initializes a new instance of `PropDbReader` for reading properties directly from an SVF property database in Autodesk APS (Forge) using an access token and model URN.
  - **Parameters:**
    - `accessToken` (`string`): A valid APS access token with permission to access the SVF model.
    - `urn` (`string`): The URN of the SVF model in Autodesk APS.
  - **Usage:** Use this constructor to access the SVF property database from a model stored in Autodesk cloud without downloading the `.sdb` file manually.

#### Methods

- `Task<Dictionary<string, object>> GetPropertiesForDbIdAsync(int dbId)`
  - **Description:** Asynchronously retrieves all properties for a given database ID (dbId) from the SVF property database.
  - **Parameters:**
    - `dbId` (`int`): The database ID of the SVF model element whose properties you want to retrieve.
  - **Returns:**
    - `Task<Dictionary<string, object>>`: A task that resolves to a dictionary containing property names and their values for the specified dbId from the SVF property database.
  - **Usage:** Call this method after initializing the reader to get all properties for a specific element in the SVF property database.

### `DbDownloader`

- `static void DownloadAndExtract(string svfUrl, string outputPath)`
  - **Description:** Downloads an SVF package from the specified URL and extracts the SVF property database (`PropDb`) to the given output path.
  - **Parameters:**
    - `svfUrl` (`string`): The URL to the SVF package (typically from Autodesk APS or Forge).
    - `outputPath` (`string`): The directory where the extracted SVF property database and related files will be saved.
  - **Usage:** Use this method to programmatically download and extract the SVF property database from an SVF model package.
  - **Exceptions:** Throws if the download fails or the SVF package is invalid.

### `ManifestHelper`

- **Description:** Provides utility methods for reading and parsing SVF manifest files, which describe the structure and contents of SVF packages, including the property database.
- **Usage:** Use these utilities to inspect or process manifest files when working with SVF models and their property database resources.
